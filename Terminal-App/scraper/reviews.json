  "me: now that I am done with finals, I just want to relax and nestle into the soothing embrace of a good bookalso me: *picks up this Romeo and Juliet retelling set in 1920s gangster-run Shanghai about star-crossed exes putting aside the blood feud between them to prevent a monster from terrorizing their city that everyone tells me it's guaranteed to break my heart*",
  "THAT ENDING THOUGH!!!!One of the best YA books of this year. Completely amazing, I love it sm.",
  "I sat down to listen to this audiobook and basically didn't get up until I finished it. It grossed me out at times which I didn't expect, but other than that it was SUCH a good read. I definitely get the hype and am so glad I finally read it!!",

  "Just posted my \n\nDec 2020 OwCrate Unboxing and Review Video\n\n!!Overall: this book was a 2.5-star read for me. It certainly had elements that were interesting but ultimately was lackluster when it came to execution. The science felt...awful...simply awful and neither of the characters felt particularly compelling to read about...I probably won't be continuing this series cause I simply cannot care enough to continue.

  "if i could sum up the story of roma and juliette, it would be this quote by toni morrison: \n\u2018we mistook violence for passion\u2026 and thought recklessness was freedom.\u2019\nthe ruthless gangs, the rekindling of a first love after betrayal, the haunting of a monster and madness, and the dramatic ploys of various nationalities trying to gain control of shanghai, this story delivers on so many fronts. i could most definitely see how this follows the tale of romeo and juliet, but at the same time, it feels soooo different. its the perfect kind of retelling, with the right balance of new and original. my only critique would be the length and pacing. its a bit slow and drawn out (mainly because there are a lot of POVs). i was hoping for something a littler faster paced, but i can understand how the depth of scene setting and history is useful to the story. also, i refuse to believe this a debut because the writing is phenomenal. i am so excited to see how it develops as the series continues!\u21a0 4 stars",

  "Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestDNF @ 15%Well, that was disappointing. The 1920s Shanghai setting hooked me and the idea of a Romeo and Juliet retelling intrigued me, because even though I'm not keen on the play, I think it offers a lot of potential for reworking the storyline. And a retelling with rival gangs? YAS.Sadly, this book just wasn't it for me. The writing was such a slog. It has that forced ornateness to it that a lot of the YA coming out these days has-- THE GILDED WOLVES, AN EMBER IN THE ASHES, THE PRISON HEALER-- and I know a lot of people really like that style of narration, but I really don't. It's all tell and no show, and everything is just laid out like a folded hand of cards.Part of my project this week is knocking out a whole bunch of books that I was really excited to read that had also been super hyped up. Most of the books sort of or really lived up to the hype but sadly, for me, this one did not.1 star",
  "Here it is, my love of 2020! I wasn\u2019t just immersed in this book, I was drowned in it. It\u2019s the kind of book you wish you could read for the first time, again and again.This was such a captivating mix of fantasy, romance, horror and mystery (basically all the things I love) packaged into this neat story that I just could not put down. The characters were all so admirable and I loved how the story played out. It wouldn\u2019t be an overstatement to call this work flawless.Waiting for the sequel is gonna be a torture, really! Loved, loved, loved this!!",
  "This author is still an undergrad in college...what have I been doing with my life??????",
